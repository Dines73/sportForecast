An over/under (O/U) bet is a wager in which a sportsbook will predict a number for
a statistic in a given game (usually the combined score of the two teams), and bettors wager that the actual
number in the game will be either higher or lower than that number. (wikipedia)
The goal of a sportsbook is to have an equal value of bets on both sides of the over–under. In theory, this
means that the manager could set the value at zero and then re-adjust based on either the number of incoming
bets and/or events that influence the potential outcome. In practice, the initial value is based on both
quantitative (e.g. win–loss record, average points per game, etc.) and anecdotal information (e.g. media
reports, injury status of players, etc.). In our case we will use the astrological data too.
